## JPEG

compression: lossy

based on DCT

The JPEG compression algorithm is at its best on photographs and paintings of realistic scenes with smooth variations of tone and color.

On the other hand, JPEG may not be as well suited for line drawings and other textual or iconic graphics, where the sharp contrasts between adjacent pixels can cause noticeable artifacts. Such images may be better saved in a lossless graphics format such as TIFF, GIF, PNG, or a raw image format.

Also has lossless option but not wide spread.

This is ideal for large images that will be displayed while downloading over a slow connection, allowing a reasonable preview after receiving only a portion of the data.
